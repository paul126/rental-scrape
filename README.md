## About

Pulls address information from rental listings. From the root page you can select to pull data from a Zillow XML feed or a Corcoran listing for NYC. From these listings, you can grab coordinates of each listing individually or request the coordinates for all listings (this takes a while due to Google's Geocode API limits, at a rate of about 1 second per 5 listings).

## Notes

Due to Heroku timeout issues and Google API limits, a link to an archived list of all rental listings was added to the root page.
